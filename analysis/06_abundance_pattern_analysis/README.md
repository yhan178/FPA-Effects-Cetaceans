# Effects of habitat changes and conservation status on porpoise abundance changes

This folder contains analyses examining the effects of habitat changes and conservation status on porpoise distributions. Specifically, the analyses include:

1. Categorization of river segments into five porpoise abundance patterns using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
2. Application of multinomial logistic regression to investigate the relationship between abundance patterns and habitat conditions.

The outputs include statistical results, tables, and figures presented in:  
	- **Section 2.3.3** and **Section 3.3** of the main text.  
	-  **Appendix S7-S9** (Tables S7-S9 and Figure S3).


## Notes on File Types
- **`.Rmd` files**: Contain the analysis code for statistical testing and visualization.
- **`.nb.html` files**: Rendered outputs of the `.Rmd` files, providing a visual representation of the analysis and results.
